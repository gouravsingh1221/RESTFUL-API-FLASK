        "\n",
        "Ans.-  A **RESTful API** is a type of web API that follows the rules of **REST (Representational State Transfer)**. It allows different systems to **communicate over the internet** using standard HTTP methods like **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE**. RESTful APIs are used to **create, read, update, or delete data** from a server in a simple and organized way.\n",

It explains what endpoints are available, what kind of requests (like GET or POST) can be made, what data you need to send, and what response you will get back. It acts like a guide or manual for developers to understand how to properly use the API.\n",

It is popular because it is **simple, flexible, and easy to use**, especially for beginners. Flask allows developers to create APIs quickly with minimal setup, and it gives them full control over how things are built. It’s also popular because it supports extensions, has good documentation, and works well for **small to medium-sized projects**.\n",

Next, you define routes using the @app.route() decorator, which connects a URL to a specific function. Inside the function, you write what the app should return when someone visits that URL, like a message or webpage. Finally, you run the app using app.run().

Flask provides a way to handle these errors using **error handler functions**. These functions are defined with the `@app.errorhandler()` decorator. The purpose is to show a **custom error message** instead of a default one.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans.- To connect Flask to a SQL database, you usually use a tool like Flask-SQLAlchemy, which makes it easier to work with databases in Python. First, you install the library and then configure the database URI (like the path to a SQLite or MySQL database) in your Flask app. After that, you create models (Python classes) that represent database tables. Flask-SQLAlchemy handles the connection and lets you easily add, read, update, or delete data from the database using Python code.\n",

Flask-SQLAlchemy simplifies tasks like **creating tables, updating records, deleting rows**, and more — all using clean and readable Python code.\n",

        "They allow you to split your app into **modules** (like user routes, admin routes, etc.) so your code stays **clean and well-structured** — especially in larger projects. Instead of writing all your routes in one file, you can define them in separate blueprints and then **register** them in the main app.\n",
